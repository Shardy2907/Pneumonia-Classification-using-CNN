# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The model is trained on the Chest X-ray Images dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal is to assist in the automated diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-ray scans.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. It consists of chest X-ray images categorized into normal and pneumonia cases. Please make sure to download and use the dataset in accordance with the licensing terms provided by Kaggle.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them as either normal or pneumonia cases. The architecture of the model includes 3 Convoluntional Layers, 3 Pooling Layers and 1 Flatten and 2 fully connected dense layers.
